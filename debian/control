Description: cryptographic store accessible through a PKCS #11
 OpenDNSSEC is a complete DNSSEC zone signing system which is very
 easy to use with stability and security in mind.  There are a lot of
 details in signing zone files with DNSSEC and OpenDNSSEC covers most
 of it.
 .
 SoftHSM 2 is a software implementation of a generic cryptographic
 device with a PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface.
 .
 This package contains common files shared between enforcer and signer.
